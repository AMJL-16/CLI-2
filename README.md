## Reference 
### For most of the website I used a similar layout found in LOVE RUNNING walkthrough project.

## Features left to implement
#### I would like to add a page with recipes in form of clickable image card that will link you to a video with a step by step recipe.
I would like to add a food tour guide with a choice of transportation (Bicycle, Motorbike, Bus, Horses..).
with different length of tour : 1, 2, 3, 4 etc..

# Testing
#### The site is reponsive enough, maybe not 100% on some smartphone which the problem will have to be adressed in the future updates of the site. I add a problem with max-width:450px wide and down screen but the problem got resolved at the end.
