    <h2 class="title1"><strong>Introduction to Normandy?</strong></h2>
    <br>
    <p class="text">
        Normandy (Normandie) is a historic and cultural region of northern France which comprises of the provinces Manche, Calvados, Orne, Eure, and Seine-Maritime. 
        <br>Previously Normandy was divided into two regions “Basse-Normandie” and “Haute-Normandie”, however in 2016 these regions were re-united to become one.
        <br>Parts of Normandy consist of rolling countryside typified by pasture for dairy cattle and apple orchards.

    <p class="text"><strong>The history of gastronomy in Normandy? </strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Normandy has some of the best ingredients and always been a dream foodie destination.<br>
        <br>Famous for producing Haute-Cuisine, it’s been a leader in providing some of France’s most indulgent and recognisable dishes for centuries.
        <br>It is not surprising that Normandy cuisine has a distinct identity with its own favourite ingredients: apples, cider, cheeses, cream, butter and more.
        <br>A wide range of dairy products are produced and exported. 
        <br>Normandy butter and Normandy cream are lavishly used in gastronomic specialties.  
        <br>
        <br>Jersey and Guernsey cattle are famous cattle breeds worldwide, especially to North America.
        <br>Turbot and oysters from the Cotentin Peninsula are major delicacies throughout France. 
        <br>Normandy is the chief oyster-cultivating, scallop-exporting, and mussel-raising region in France.
        <br>

        <strong>Fun fact</strong>
        <br>
        <br>Normandy is the largest producer of “huîtres creuses” in France.''
        <br>so much so that one in every three oysters consumed in France comes from Normandy. 
        <br>
        <br>Normandy is a major cider-producing region (very little wine is produced). brandy, of which the most famous variety is calvados, is also popular. 
        <br>The mealtime trou normand, or "Norman hole", is a pause between meal courses in which diners partake of a glassful of calvados in order to improve the appetite and make room for the next course, and this is still observed in many homes and restaurants. 
        <br>Pommeau is an apéritif produced by blending unfermented cider and apple brandy. 
        <br>Another aperitif is the kir normand, a measure of crème de cassis topped up with cider. Bénédictine is produced in Fécamp.
